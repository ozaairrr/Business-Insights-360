## 🔍 Key Metrics & DAX Logic

- 📊 **Net Profit $** = Gross Margin + Operational Expense (negative sign handled in formula)  
- 🎯 **Forecast Accuracy %** = 1 – Absolute Error  
- 🚨 **Risk Classification** = Excess Inventory / Out of Stock based on Net Error  
- 🧠 **Dynamic P&L**: SWITCH logic to drive matrix values across 17 P&L stages  
- 📅 **YTD vs YTG Logic**: Dynamically classifies months into “Year-To-Date” or “Year-To-Go” using latest sales date  
- 🔀 **Benchmark Switching**: GM % & NP % switch between LY vs Target based on slicer selection
